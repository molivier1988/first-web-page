<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently employed as a cyber security consultant advising large corporate clients on how
they can protect their vital information assets and intellectual property whilst being able to
take advantage new market opportunities.</p>

<p>Having spent 22 years in the Royal Navy most of that in the submarine service, I'd always
had an interest in PC's building my own from the late 80's to early 90'. So it was an easy
decision to enter the world of IT when I was demobed. Cyber security was still a very new 
concept back in 2010 when I started work for a small boutique consultancy, Vistorm.</p>

<p>On the personnal front I've been married to my lovely wife, Julie for 22 years now. We have
one son, Louis who is 16 and currently living away from home attending college in Oxford. I enjoy
playing golf, cycling, watching and coaching rugby.</p>
<p>Our team is Wasps Rugby who unfortunately went bankrupts in 2022 but although stung there's still life. 
Wasps are due to play in the English championship (one level below the premiership) </p> <img src="../assets/images/wasp.png" alt="">

<p>My go to motto is <em>Work to live don't live to work</em></p>
